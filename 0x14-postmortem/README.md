#Holberton School - 0x14-postmortem

## Summary
From April 1st to April 7th, 2017, the entire country of Vietnam experienced an outage to internet connectivity, causing slow to no connectivity to the internet. It took place from approximately 2:16am ICT-May 31st, 2017 to approximately 5:15pm ICT-April 7th, 2017. 100% of Vietnam's users were unable to access any websites. The root cause was hungry sharks.

## Timeline
- 2:16am ICT, April 1st - teenagers from the Ba Dinh district in Hanoi called FPT customer service to report their session of the online game DOTA 2 had stalled. Thinking it was an April Fools prank, they began to worry after 10 minutes. 
- 6:30am ICT, April 1st - waiting for their workday to officially get started, engineers used strace to find the problem laid in a deeper hardware issue as all ports were unabled to be accessed.
- 9:00am ICT, April 3rd - the seaops team dived into the waters of Ba Ria in the Vung Tau province, where the undersea cables are laid.
- 10:35am ICT, April 3rd - the seaops team discover massive bite marks on the undersea fibre optic cables. The team suspects these are the bite marks of a Alopias pelagicus shark common to Ba Ria.

## Root Causes
The waters of Ba Ria have been the victim of overfishing, causing sharks to eat and bite alternative sources of sustenance. Also, the shark mistaken the electromagnetic waves for bioelectric fields that surround schools of fish.

## Resolution
From 6:30am ICT, April 4th to 9:00pm ICT, April 7th, the seaops team replaced the sections of undersea fibre optic cables bitten by the sharks. They also exterminated Alopias pelagicus sharks within the vicinity, as well as along the route of the cables.

## Corrective and preventative measures
June 2017: Russian oil companies in Vung Tau have pledged to re-populate the region with more fish in order to feed the sharks.

July 2018 (pending): Google has also offered to help clad the undersea fibre optic cables with Kevlar-like material. Due to the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) by the Trump Administration, this arrangement is pending a re-instatement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), or amended by-laws of the agreement.

August 2018 (pending): FitBit, emboldened with their latest acquisition of the smartwatch company Pebble, will deploy devices that will emit electromagnetic waves towards where the fish will resides, diverging the sharks away from the cables. This arrangment is also pending the aforementioned TPP re-instatement.

January 2019: Deputy Prime Minister Vuong Dinh Hue will propose a draft mandating all households have DOTA 2 pre-installed on their computers in an effort to increase the efficiency of internet connectivity monitoring. The budget will come from a decrease in FPT's devops team budget for the fiscal years of 2019-2024.
